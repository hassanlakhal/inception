## üöÄ Build and Run the Containers

Before starting the project, create the necessary local directories for persistent volume storage:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/database $HOME/data
```

Then, clone the repository and navigate into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hassanlakhal/inception.git
cd inception
```

Now, build and run the containers using:

```bash
make
```

Once the setup is complete, open your browser and visit:

```
https://<your-domain-name>
```

For example:

```
https://hlakhal.42.fr
```
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Replace `<your-domain-name>` with the actual domain configured in your `.env` and NGINX setup and in file hosts in /etc.
